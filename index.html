            <p class="bio">I am a second year Ph.D. student affiliated with the <a href="http://www.rle.mit.edu/" target="_blank"><b>Research Lab for Electronics (RLE)</b></a> at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I currently work under the advisorship of <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~soljacic/marin.html" target="_blank"><b>Prof. Marin Soljačić</b></a> in the <a href="http://www.rle.mit.edu/marin/" target="_blank"><b>Photonics and Modern Electromagnetics Group</b></a>.

            I am most interested in understanding new and surprising ways in which light can interact with matter. I work at the interface between theory and experiment, using advances in materials platforms and nanofabrication capabilities to motivate theoretical studies. More information about my research interests and projects can be found below.</p>

                        <h2>Quantum electrodynamics in time-dependent media</h2>
                        <p>One of the most profound insights of quantum electrodynamics (QED) is that the vacuum is not a void; rather, it teems with activity – a sea of quantum fluctuations which can interact with matter and even be converted into light. These vacuum fluctuations have fascinated physicists for decades, leading to the study of many vacuum-induced phenomena. Perhaps most well known is the Casimir effect, which famously predicts how two uncharged conducting plates, when placed close together, experience mutual attraction due to the fluctuating electromagnetic fields between the plates. Less well-known is the “dynamical” Casimir effect (DCE), in which two rapidly oscillating conducting plates produce entangled pairs of real photons at half the frequency of oscillation. This effect was predicted in 1970, but escaped observation until 2011 when it was realized in a system using microwave transmission lines and a SQUID modulator to quickly control the optical path length.

                        <br><br>
                        While the dynamical casimir effect usually refers to the specific case of a time-changing medium with oscillatory character, this phenomenon is part of a much larger class of dynamical vacuum effects. Any electromagnetic system which can be characterized by time-changing response functions can convert vacuum fluctuations into real photons. I am interested in exploring the potential intersection between the dynamical vacuum effects and nanophotonic structures and materials, with the hope that modern materials platforms and nanoscale manufacturing capabilities may provide untapped opportunities to observe these dynamical vacuum effects in a richer variety of systems. As a first step toward this goal, I have been developing a general quantum framework to describe photon emission in time-dependent nanophotonic systems.

                        <h2>Strong interactions between polaritons and matter</h2>
                        <p>It is well known that spontaneous emission is one of the most fundamental processes of light matter interaction. The rate of spontaneous emission of a level system is determined both by the electronic structure of the emitter, as well as its photonic environment. Through what is commonly known as the Purcell effect, it is possible to engineer the photonic environment of an emitter so that the rate of spontaneous emission is enhanced by many orders of magnitude. In my most recent work, I showed that excitations called surface magnon polaritons on negative permeability materials may enable interactions with spin transitions to occur more than 10 orders of magnitude faster than in free space. </p>
